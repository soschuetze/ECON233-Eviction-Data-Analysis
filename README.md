# ECON233-Eviction-Data-Analysis
This study’s question of interest is how statewide eviction moratoria impacted the number of evictions per day for zip codes in 27 different cities 
from March 27, 2020 to September 4, 2020. This paper will also look at the majority race by census tract and changes in consumer spending and 
employment levels by city to determine their correlation with the number of evictions since those factors could influence the magnitude of the pandemic’s
financial repercussions on individuals. Overall, the number of people evicted during this health crisis is necessary to study because of its potential 
consequences. Moving during the pandemic presents health risks, especially if someone is already coming from a low-income and higher-incidence rate 
area or having to move into a shared living space - exacerbating existing health inequities. Additionally, because of the economic recession, if people 
are evicted from their homes and struggling to find a job or keep a steady income, they face a greater risk of homelessness which can lead to lifelong 
effects. Therefore, studying the rate of evictions and correlating factors during the COVID-19 pandemic could help predict these outcomes and inform 
about what solutions could best be implemented to help those affected.
